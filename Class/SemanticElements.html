        <h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
    </section>
    <main>Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer who currently plays Test cricket and ODI cricket for
        India. Kohli is a former T20I player and a former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a
        right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He currently represents Royal
        Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in
        IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also
        holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most
        international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and
        the modern era. </main>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <article>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin
        Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
        "successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[21][22]
        His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is
        well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and
        attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades
        from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing
        style.[24] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian
        cricketer.[25] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of
        shots,[26] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who
        has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[27]
